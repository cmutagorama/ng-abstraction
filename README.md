# NG Abstraction

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

- I built a base input component with common properties and methods useful to all extending components, that would decrease the code repetition and mass to a minimum. This is available in Angular, but with a twist.

- Then extended the base component on two different components: `app-input` and `app-input-with-label`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
